# 🚨 LARGE FILES SOLUTION

## Problem Identified
We have 2 files larger than 10MB that are causing deployment issues:

1. **Arcades3.jpg** - 10.27 MB (Image)
2. **Lamp Building 2.MP4** - 16.34 MB (Video)

## Why This Causes Issues
- GitHub has soft limits on file sizes (recommended < 50MB, warning at 100MB)
- Vercel and other hosting platforms may have issues with large files
- Large files slow down repository cloning and deployment
- Mobile users experience slow loading times

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Compress Files (Recommended)
**For Images:**
- Use TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh to compress `Arcades3.jpg`
- Target: Reduce from 10.27MB to under 2MB
- Quality: 85-90% should maintain visual quality

**For Videos:**
- Use HandBrake, CloudConvert, or ffmpeg to compress `Lamp Building 2.MP4`
- Target: Reduce from 16.34MB to under 5MB
- Settings: H.264 codec, reduce bitrate, optimize for web

### Option 2: External Hosting
- Upload large files to a CDN (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.)
- Update project.json URLs to point to external URLs
- Keep smaller placeholder files in the repository

### Option 3: Progressive Loading
- Create thumbnail/preview versions for immediate display
- Load full-resolution versions on demand
- Implement lazy loading for better performance

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Compress Files
```bash
# For video compression (using ffmpeg if available)
ffmpeg -i "Lamp Building 2.MP4" -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k "Lamp Building 2_compressed.MP4"

# For image compression, use online tools:
# - TinyPNG: https://tinypng.com/
# - Squoosh: https://squoosh.app/
```

### Step 2: Update References
Update `public/projects/Burgertify/project.json` to reference the compressed files.

### Step 3: Test and Deploy
- Test locally to ensure media still loads properly
- Commit and deploy the optimized files

## Current File Status
- ✅ URL encoding fixes applied (handles spaces in filenames)
- ⚠️  Large files need optimization
- ✅ Media debug panel available for testing

## Next Actions
1. Compress the 2 large files
2. Replace them in the repository
3. Test media loading on both desktop and mobile
4. Deploy and verify the fix works in production
