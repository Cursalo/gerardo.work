# Project Status: Minimal 3D Portfolio (v2)

**Last Updated:** November 29, 2023

## Overall Status: Planning & Initial Setup

This project is at the initial planning and foundation-setting stage for a complete rebuild (Version 2). The core objective is to create a cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable version of the Minimal 3D Portfolio, leveraging Supabase as the backend.

## Current Phase: Definition and Design

*   [x] **Tech Stack Definition:** Completed (React, TypeScript, Vite, R3F, Supabase).
*   [x] **Core Requirements (PRD):** Initial draft completed.
*   [x] **Technical Requirements:** Initial draft completed.
*   [x] **Frontend Architecture Plan:** Initial draft completed.
*   [x] **Backend Architecture Plan (Supabase):** Initial draft completed including data models.
*   [x] **Application Flow Documentation:** Initial draft completed.
*   [ ] **Detailed UI/UX Design:** To be started.
*   [ ] **Supabase Project Setup:** To be initiated (account creation, project initialization).
*   [ ] **Database Schema Implementation:** To be implemented in Supabase based on `backend.md`.
*   [ ] **RLS Policies Implementation:** To be implemented in Supabase.

## Next Steps

1.  **Review and Refine Documentation:** Iterate on the PRD, requirements, and architecture documents.
2.  **UI/UX Design:** Create wireframes and mockups for the public portfolio and admin panel.
3.  **Supabase Setup:**
    *   Create a new Supabase project.
    *   Implement the database schema (tables, relationships).
    *   Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
    *   Set up Storage buckets.
4.  **Frontend Project Initialization:**
    *   Set up a new React/TypeScript/Vite project.
    *   Install necessary dependencies.
    *   Establish the basic directory structure.
5.  **Begin Core Feature Development:**
    *   Admin authentication.
    *   Basic CRUD operations for Projects.

## Known Blockers/Risks

*   Complexity of creating a user-friendly 3D scene configuration interface in the admin panel.
*   Performance optimization for 3D assets on various devices.
*   Time estimation for a full rebuild.

## Milestones (High-Level)

*   **M1: Backend Ready:** Supabase schema, RLS, and storage configured.
*   **M2: Admin Panel Core:** Authentication and Project/Media CRUD functional.
*   **M3: Frontend Portfolio Shell:** Basic 3D scene rendering, navigation, and project display from backend.
*   **M4: Feature Complete:** All defined features implemented.
*   **M5: Testing & Refinement:** Thorough testing, bug fixing, performance tuning.
*   **M6: Deployment:** Public launch.
